## Streaming Music
The idea is to have a compact device that can stream music from a source, or load it from its existing memory, that combined with a capable player and a motion detection mechanism make the **Wio Play** a handy piece of technology.

### Proccess
The full process of streaming a track on our service can be broken down into 3 key steps interconnected together using MQTT, the full process eventually concludes when the chosen song has been played fully on the terminal

1. Pinging Terminal
    - Happens once when the user requests to play a specific song, this will put the terminal in `Note Requesting` state 

2. Requesting Notes
    - During the `Note Requesting` state, the terminal will ask the app for more musical notes whenever the current chunk of notes has been played fully and exhausted

3. Sending Notes
    - Once the app receives a request from the terminal asking for more notes, it sends the next notes chunk in the queue back to the terminal

### Diagram
The steps described above can be seen in the sequence diagram below:
