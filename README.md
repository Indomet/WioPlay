# Wio Play

</div>

## Purpose

The purpose of Wio Play is motivating people to lose calories by effectively utilising the terminal's components and the user experience of the android app

## Benefits

- Large Song Library ðŸŽµ

  - **50+** **songs** currently available

- Maintainability ðŸ”„

  - Songs are automatically **maintained on the server**

- Media Storage ðŸ’¾

  - Downloaded songs are **cached on the app**

- Motion Detection ðŸ‘Ÿ
  - Utilizes the **small form factor** of the WIO terminal

<!-- [**Wiki**](https://github.com/Indomet/WioPlay/wiki) -->

## How It Works

The idea is to have a compact device that can stream music from a source, or load it from its existing memory, that combined with a capable player and a motion detection mechanism make the **Wio Play** a handy piece of technology.

### Steps

The process of streaming a track on our service can be broken down into 3 key steps interconnected together using MQTT, the full process eventually concludes when the chosen song has been played fully on the terminal

1. Pinging Terminal

   - Happens once when the user requests to play a specific song, this will put the terminal in the `Note Requesting` state

2. Requesting Notes

   - During the `Note Requesting` state, the terminal will ask the app for more musical notes whenever the current chunk of notes has been played fully and exhausted

3. Sending Notes
   - Once the app receives a request from the terminal asking for more notes, it sends the next notes chunk in the queue back to the terminal

### Diagram

The steps described above can be seen in the sequence diagram below:

For more detailed diagrams about the system please refer to the following wiki pages

- [Software Architecture](https://github.com/Indomet/WioPlay/wiki/Software-Architecture)
- [Diagrams](https://github.com/Indomet/WioPlay/wiki/Diagrams)


## Setup

The system consists of 3 main components, the **Android application**, the **WIO terminal**, and the **Note-Parser** server that is responsible for providing and parsing the song library. All three components must be set up correctly for the system to function properly.

In order to get all the project files, you must clone the project repo:

`git clone git@github.com:Indomet/WioPlay.git`

### Android App 

#### - Using Gradle ![Gradle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gradle-02303A.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Gradle&logoColor=white)

Assuming you already have a device or emulator attached, you can build the application using gradle.
 1. `gradlew assembleDebug` to build a debug apk which can then be installed 
 2. `gradlew installDebug` to build and immediately install the apk onto the attached device

#### - Using Android Studio ![Android Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Studio-3DDC84.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=android-studio&logoColor=white)

To install the Android app on your personal device, please make sure to have [_Android Studio Flamingo or newer_](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed on your machine.

- Navigate to the File menu, then open the project from the AndroidApp folder.
- Connect your device to the computer, alternatively you can install an emulator with the help of the Android Studio device manager.
- At the top of the screen, make sure to select your device
- Click the run icon, while making sure the phone is open. A popup should appear asking for permission to install the app, press yes. Now the phone can be unplugged from the computer and the app will function as a normal Android application.

### Note Parser
The NoteParser was developed with maven, which means you can use the pom.xml file thats present in the repo to build, verify, and execute the project.

#### - Using Maven ![Apache Maven](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Maven-C71A36?style=for-the-badge&logo=Apache%20Maven&logoColor=white)

Assuming you have maven installed and present in your path
1. `mvn install` to build a copy of the project (includes JAR)
2. `mvn exec:java` to directly execute the MainClass and run the application

### Wio Terminal

Compiling and uploading the Arduino code to your Wio Terminal.
#### - Using Arduino-CLI ![Arduino](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Arduino-00979D?style=for-the-badge&logo=Arduino&logoColor=white)

1. `arduino-cli compile -b <fqbn> WioPlay/` to compile the workspace
2. `arduino-cli upload -p <port> -b <fqbn> WioPlay/` to upload the compiled workspace onto the device

*Note: **&lt;fqbn&gt;** and **&lt;port&gt;** correspond to the device fqbn number and USB connection port respectively*

#### - Using IDE
- In the Arduino IDE, navigate to: **group-10-dit113-v23-mini-project-systems-development/seeed-wio-terminal/WioPlay** and open the folder.
- Connect the Wio Seeed Terminal to your computer.
- Plug in the grove speaker to **port 1** on the Wio Seeed Terminal.
![IMAGE_DESCRIPTION](https://i.imgur.com/IELVBrE.png)
- Create a header file named "**WifiInformation.h**", copy paste and fill in each field in the following format:

`#define SSID "Wifi-name-here"`

`#define PASSWORD "Password-here"`

`#define my_IPv4 "Broker-adress-here"`


- Go to line 9 in MqttConnection.h and uncomment `"#include "WifiInformation.h"`
- Compile and upload the sketch to the Wio Seeed Terminal.
- If you have the battery pack attached, now it is safe to unplug, otherwise please attach the battery pack.

### Using the system

After completing the installation process, you can start using the system by first launching the note parser and the Android app. The app should automatically send a message to the server and receive all the available songs, as well as storing them to the phone's storage at /Documents. the three files created should be songList.json, user.json, and workoutManager.json.

After that, turn on the Wio terminal, if you are a first time user, you must navigate to the settings page in the app and enter your information, which is used to provide you with your personal workout data. Then navigate to the workout page and pick a workout you would like to do, choose the calorie goal and duration, and press start.

As you exercise while holding the Wio terminal, it will detect your movements and calculate the amount of calories you are burning, in the bottom of the workout page, you can see real time statistics of the calories burnt, which will also be converted to a 1:1 ratio into calorie credits.

In the music library page, you can spend the calorie credits you earned from burning calories to unlock new songs. After unlocking a song, a play button will appear for that specific song, by pressing it, the Wio terminal will begin to play that song.

While exercising, you can press and hold the joystick to view the real-time burn-down chart, which shows your current calorie burning rate as well as the estimated line which you should try and keep up with in order to reach your calorie goal within the workout duration.

While playing music, you can use the left and right button to cycle through all the songs that you currently have unlocked, and the middle button to pause/resume the song.

All progress and user data is kept until the app is deleted from the phone.

Have fun!
